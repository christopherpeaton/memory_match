        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This game is a simple match game, but I chose to use cars as the topic.  I love cars.  All types, sizes, vintage,
                air cooled, water cooled, american, german, italian, british, japanese.  To me it doesn't matter, as long as
                it goes, and it goes well.  For as long as I can remember I have had an interest in cars, and this symbolizes
                that passion.

        <h3>Skills needed for project completion</h3>
            <p>
                For the completion of this project, a knowledge of several areas was necessary.  Base knowledge of html/css
                was a must, but also the knowledge to look for/find how to do things I didn't know how to do.  Google is my
                friend.  How to work a text editor was a must, as was time management.  Basic understanding of bootstrap, and
                some javascript was also helpful.
