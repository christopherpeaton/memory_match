    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This game is a simple match game, but I chose to use cars as the topic. I love cars. All types, sizes, vintage,
        air cooled, water cooled, american, german, italian, british, japanese. To me it doesn't matter, as long as
        it goes, and it goes well. For as long as I can remember I have had an interest in cars, and this symbolizes
        that passion.

    <h3>Skills needed for project completion</h3>

    <p>
        For the completion of this project, a knowledge of several areas was necessary. Base knowledge of html/css
        was a must, but also the knowledge to look for/find how to do things I didn't know how to do. Google is my
        friend. How to work a text editor was a must, as was time management.  An understanding of bootstrap as well as
        javascript was also helpful.
